Koalagator
=========

About
-----

Koalagator is an open source community calendaring platform.
The project is a community fork of the community developed project Calagator.
Koalagator is run by a wholly new core team, contributors welcome.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to the original calagator project. 
We appreciate the encouragment from the ruby community for us to undertaking a revivial of this project.
Koalagator is a hard fork of calagator. We've upgraded the project from Rails 4.2 to Rails 7.1 as part of this revival.

About the revival
-----------------

The calagator project has much to celebrate in creating a vibrant community calander platform.
In the late 2010's, the calagator project became effectivley inactive. An out-of-date rails version (v4.2) as well as a range of build issues and development bugs made it difficult to start new projects or receive support.

Over the last year our new team, based in Australia, have been gradually slaying dragons to undertake the unenviable task of upgrading the calagator code base across multiple major Rails versions. We are pleased to announce that in March 2024 we bought the project up to the current latest version of ruby and rails. 

With the calagator core team inactive and not open to processing Pull Requests, in communication with them they said they encouraged community forks. 

In March 2024 we are now releasing koalagator as a community fork of calagator.

The koalagator project will seek to improve on the calendar platform taking into account the needs community ecosystems in the 2020's.

We'd love you to join us on the journey.

Ps. We're still settling in so there may still be references to calagator while we're still setting up
